# CGI scripts

The scripts in this directory use the [Common Gateway
Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) as an
alternative to the [Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org/) in the
[`portfolioapi` directory](../portfolioapi/).  These scripts are not maintained
so that changes may be necessary to make them work as a proper alternative.
The scripts use modules from the `portfolioapi` directory.
